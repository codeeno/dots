# Eeno's Dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles. I use these on my personal machines and servers running macOS and Arch-based Linux distros.

## Installation

To set up these dotfiles using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/):

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/codeeno/dots
$ cd dots
$ stow --target $HOME */
```
